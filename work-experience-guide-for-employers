<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This is for employers who would like to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand the benefits of offering work experience</li>
  <li>find a suitable work experience programme</li>
</ul>

<p>Work experience is an effective way of preparing young people and adults for employment. It can help to inform career choices, get people back into work, allow people to prove themselves to employers, and can help to instil the attitudes and behaviours expected at work.</p>

<p>Work experience includes a wide range of activities aimed at providing experience of the work environment. Placements can be either paid or unpaid, although some employers may choose to pay a wage even if not required to.</p>

<p>This guidance provides information about a range of government skills programmes that feature work experience or work placements, why employers might like to get involved and how to do so. We have also included useful resources about planning work experience placements, health and safety, supported internship placements and accreditation.</p>

<h2 id="benefits-of-offering-work-experience">Benefits of offering work experience</h2>

<p>Employers who offer work experience highlight these benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>recruitment</strong> – by identifying high-quality future recruits and raising the profile of your business and sector. It also offers an opportunity to get to know or ‘try out’ a potential employee before offering them a job</li>
  <li>
<strong>staff development</strong> – by allowing your current staff to develop and gain experience of supervision and people management skills</li>
  <li>
<strong>increased capacity</strong> – by filling temporary skills gaps or vacancies, providing extra capacity or releasing current staff for other work</li>
  <li>
<strong>new ideas and approaches</strong> – by bringing fresh energy and motivation into your organisation, increasing the diversity of your workforce and generating new ideas, approaches and ways of looking at the world</li>
</ul>

<p>Aside from benefits to your organisation, there is also a strong social case. Offering work experience can give young people their first taste of a work environment. It can help to inform career choices and can help to instil the attitudes and behaviours expected at work. An extended period of unemployment can affect future employment prospects and lead to ill-health and poverty; work experience can help to prevent this, providing enormous benefits both to the individual and to the community.</p>
