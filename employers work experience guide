<H2 id="overview">Overview</H2>
<P>This is for employers who would like to:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>understand the benefits of offering work experience</LI>
  <LI>find a suitable work experience programme</LI></UL>
<P>Work experience is an effective way of preparing young people and adults for 
employment. It can help to inform career choices, get people back into work, 
allow people to prove themselves to employers, and can help to instil the 
attitudes and behaviours expected at work.</P>
<P>Work experience includes a wide range of activities aimed at providing 
experience of the work environment. Placements can be either paid or unpaid, 
although some employers may choose to pay a wage even if not required to.</P>
<P>This guidance provides information about a range of government skills 
programmes that feature work experience or work placements, why employers might 
like to get involved and how to do so. We have also included useful resources 
about planning work experience placements, health and safety, supported 
internship placements and accreditation.</P>
<H2 id="benefits-of-offering-work-experience">Benefits of offering work 
experience</H2>
<P>Employers who offer work experience highlight these benefits:</P>
<UL>
  <LI><STRONG>recruitment</STRONG> – by identifying high-quality future recruits 
  and raising the profile of your business and sector. It also offers an 
  opportunity to get to know or ‘try out’ a potential employee before offering 
  them a job</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>staff development</STRONG> – by allowing your current staff to 
  develop and gain experience of supervision and people management skills</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>increased capacity</STRONG> – by filling temporary skills gaps or 
  vacancies, providing extra capacity or releasing current staff for other 
  work</LI>
  <LI><STRONG>new ideas and approaches</STRONG> – by bringing fresh energy and 
  motivation into your organisation, increasing the diversity of your workforce 
  and generating new ideas, approaches and ways of looking at the world</LI></UL>
<P>Aside from benefits to your organisation, there is also a strong social case. 
Offering work experience can give young people their first taste of a work 
environment. It can help to inform career choices and can help to instil the 
attitudes and behaviours expected at work. An extended period of unemployment 
can affect future employment prospects and lead to ill-health and poverty; work 
experience can help to prevent this, providing enormous benefits both to the 
individual and to the community.</P>
